                I been riding 'round in rental cars, tryna lay low
                I'm a real Soulja Boy, I really play with Dracos
                Took the whole gang from out the hood, then put 'em on a payroll
                Having flashbacks of hittin' the red with the K-roll (bow, bow)
                She just had a baby for me, so I paid to get her makeover (makeover)
                I was being calm, it's like it's there for me to take over (take over). I like this song
                because it sounds really good. I can't really to any of the messages, but it
                sounds really good. In terms of what these lyrics say about the artist, 
                I'd say that they say he lives a bit of a reckless life, likes sports, 
                and cares about his community.
